#' Get metadata of pdqr-function
#'
#' Tools for getting metadata of **pdqr-function**: a function which represents
#' distribution with finite support and finite values of probability/density.
#' The key metadata which defines underline distribution is **"x_tbl"**. If two
#' pdqr-functions have the same "x_tbl" metadata, they represent the same
#' distribution and can be converted to one another with `as_*()` family of
#' functions.
#'
#' @param f A pdqr-function.
#'
#' @details Internally storage of metadata is implemented as follows:
#' - Pdqr class is a first "appropriate" ("p", "d", "q", or "r") S3 class of
#' pdqr-function. All "proper" pdqr-functions have full S3 class of the form:
#' `c(cl, "pdqr", "function")`, where `cl` is pdqr class.
#' - Pdqr type, support, and "x_tbl" are stored into function's
#' [environment][environment()].
#'
#' @section Pdqr class:
#'
#' Pdqr class is returned by `meta_class()`. This can be one of "p", "d", "q",
#' "r". Represents **how pdqr-function describes underlying distribution**:
#' - P-function (i.e. of class "p") returns value of cumulative distribution
#' function (probability of random variable being not more than certain value)
#' at points `q` (its numeric vector input). Internally it is implemented as
#' direct integration of corresponding (with the same "x_tbl" metadata)
#' d-function.
#' - D-function returns value of probability mass or density function (depending
#' on pdqr type) at points `x` (its numeric vector input). Internally it is
#' implemented by directly using "x_tbl" metadata (see section '"x_tbl"
#' metadata' for more details).
#' - Q-function returns value of quantile function at points `p` (its numeric
#' vector input). Internally it is implemented as inverse of corresponding
#' p-function (returns the smallest "x" value which has cumulative probability
#' not less than input).
#' - R-function generates random sample of size `n` (its single number input)
#' from distribution. Internally it is implemented using inverse transform
#' sampling: certain amount of points from [standard uniform
#' distribution][stats::runif()] is generated, and the output is values of
#' corresponding q-function at generated points.
#'
#' These names are chosen so as to follow [base R
#' convention][stats::Distributions] of naming distribution functions. All
#' pdqr-functions take only one argument with the same meaning as the first ones
#' in base R. It has no other arguments specific to some parameters of
#' distribution family. To emulate their other common arguments, use the
#' following transformations (here `d_f` means a function of class "d", etc.):
#' - For `d_f(x, log = TRUE)` use `log(d_f(x))`.
#' - For `p_f(q, lower.tail = FALSE)` use `1 - p_f(q)`.
#' - For `p_f(q, log.p = TRUE)` use `log(p_f(q))`.
#' - For `q_f(p, lower.tail = FALSE)` use `q_f(1 - p)`.
#' - For `q_f(p, log.p = TRUE)` use `q_f(exp(p))`.
#'
#' @section Pdqr type:
#'
#' Pdqr type is returned by `meta_type()`. This can be one of "discrete" or
#' "continuous". Represents **type of underlying distribution**:
#' - Type "discrete" is used for distributions with finite number of outcomes.
#' Functions with "discrete" type has a fixed set of "x" values ("x" column in
#' "x_tbl" metadata) on which d-function returns possibly non-zero output
#' (values from "prob" column in "x_tbl" metadata).
#' - Type "continuous" is used to represent continuous distributions with
#' piecewise-linear density with finite values and on finite support. Density
#' goes through points defined by "x" and "y" columns in "x_tbl" metadata.
#'
#' @section Pdqr support:
#' Pdqr support is returned by `meta_support()`. This is a numeric vector with
#' two finite values. Represents **support of underlying distribution**: closed
#' interval, outside of which d-function is equal to zero. **Note** that inside
#' of support d-function can also be zero, which especially true for "discrete"
#' functions.
#'
#' Technically, pdqr support is range of values from "x" column of "x_tbl"
#' metadata.
#'
#' @section "x_tbl" metadata:
#'
#' Metadata "x_tbl" is returned by `meta_x_tbl()`. This is a key metadata which
#' **completely defines distribution**. It is a data frame with three numeric
#' columns, content of which partially depends on pdqr type.
#'
#' Type "discrete" functions have "x_tbl" with columns "x", "prob", "cumprob".
#' D-functions return a value from "prob" column for input which is very near
#' (should be equal up to ten digits, defined by [round(*, digits =
#' 10)][round()]) to corresponding value of "x" column. Rounding is done to
#' account for issues with representation of numerical values (see Note section
#' of [`==`]'s help page). For any other input, d-functions return
#' zero.
#'
#' Type "continuous" functions have "x_tbl" with columns "x", "y", "cumprob".
#' D-functions return a value of piecewise-linear function passing through
#' points that have "x" and "y" coordinates. For any value outside support (i.e.
#' strictly less than minimum "x" and strictly more than maximum "x") output is
#' zero.
#'
#' Column "cumprob" always represents the probability of underlying random
#' variable being not more than corresponding value in "x" column.
#'
#' @section Change of metadata:
#'
#' All metadata of pdqr-functions are not meant to be changed directly. Also
#' change of pdqr type, support, and "x_tbl" metadata will lead to a complete
#' change of underlying distribution.
#'
#' To change **pdqr class**, for example to convert p-function to d-function,
#' use `as_*()` family of functions: [as_p()], [as_d()], [as_q()], [as_r()].
#'
#' To change **pdqr type**, use [form_retype()]. It changes underlying
#' distribution in the most suitable for user way.
#'
#' To change **pdqr support**, use [form_resupport()] or [form_tails()].
#'
#' Change of **"x_tbl" metadata** is not possible, because basically it means
#' creating completely new pdqr-function. To do that, supply data frame with
#' "x_tbl" format suitable for desired "type" to appropriate `new_*()` function:
#' [new_p()], [new_d()], [new_q()], [new_r()]. Also, there is a [form_regrid()]
#' function which will increase or decrease granularity of pdqr-function.
#'
#' @return `meta_all()` returns a list of all metadata. `meta_class()`,
#'   `meta_type()`, `meta_support`, and `meta_x_tbl()` return corresponding
#'   metadata.
