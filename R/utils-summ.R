#' `piecequad_*` - list of `x` (interval breaks with length at least 2), `a`,
#' `b`, and `c` (all are coefficients of quadratic equations), defining
#' piecewise-quadratic on n-1 intervals (`n` is length of `x`) function on the
#' finite subset of real line in the following way:
#' - `a[i]*t^2+b[i]*t+c[i]` when `t` is in `c(x[i-1], x[i])` (`i` in `1:(n-1)`).
#'
#' @return X-values of points where intersections of piecewise-quadratics occur
#' inside of intersection support (common subinterval of both `piecequad`s).
#' The reason behind this is that inside 'pdqr' framework it is non-trivial to
#' analyse crossings inside intersection support.
#'
#' If intersection support is empty, `numeric(0)` is returned. If supports
#' intersect on one point, it is returned only in case it is a crossing.
