#' Summarize distributions with separation threshold
#'
#' Compute for pair of pdqr-functions the optimal threshold that separates
#' distributions they represent. In other words, `summ_separation()` solves a
#' binary classification problem with one-dimensional linear classifier: values
#' not more than some threshold are classified as one class, and more than
#' threshold - as another. Order of input functions doesn't matter.
#'
#' @param f A pdqr-function of any [type][meta_type()] and
#'   [class][meta_class()]. Represents "true" distribution of "negative" values.
#' @param g A pdqr-function of any type and class. Represents "true"
#'   distribution of "positive" values.
#' @param method Separation method. Should be one of "KS" (Kolmogorov-Smirnov),
#'   "GM", "OP", "F1", "MCC" (all four are methods for computing classification
#'   metric in [summ_classmetric()]).
#' @param n_grid Number of grid points to be used during optimization.
#'
#' @details All methods:
#' - Return middle point of nearest support edges in case of non-overlapping or
#' "touching" supports of `f` and `g`.
#' - Return the smallest optimal solution in case of several candidates.
#'
#' Method "KS" computes "x" value at which corresponding p-functions of `f` and
#' `g` achieve supremum of their absolute difference (so input order of `f` and
#' `g` doesn't matter). If input pdqr-functions have the same
#' [type][meta_type()], then result is a point of maximum absolute difference.
#' If inputs have different types, then absolute difference of p-functions at
#' the result point can be not the biggest. In that case output represents a
#' left limit of points at which target supremum is reached (see Examples).
#'
#' Methods "GM", "OP", "F1", "MCC" compute threshold which maximizes
#' corresponding [classification metric][summ_classmetric()] for best suited
#' classification setup. They evaluate metrics at equidistant grid (with
#' `n_grid` elements) for both directions (`summ_classmetric(f, g, *)` and
#' `summ_classmetric(g, f, *)`) and return threshold which results into maximum
#' of both setups. **Note** that other `summ_classmetric()` methods are either
#' useless here (always return one of the edges) or are equivalent to ones
#' already present.
#'
#' @return A single number representing optimal separation threshold.
#'
#' @seealso [summ_roc()] for computing ROC curve related summaries.
#'
#' [summ_classmetric()] for computing of classification metric for ordered
#' classification setup.

#' **Notes** about method choice:
#' - "Acc" and "YI"  are equivalent to "KS" separation in terms of output.

#' - "DOR" and "Simple" metrics are useless because always return edge of some
