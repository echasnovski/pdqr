#' Change type of pdqr-function
#'
#' Modify [type][meta_type()] of pdqr-function using method of choice.
#'
#' @param f A pdqr-function.
#' @param type A desired type of output. Should be one of "discrete" or
#'   "continuous".
#' @param method Retyping method. Should be one of "piecelin", "dirac", "value".
#'
#' @details If type of `f` is equal to input `type` then `f` is returned.
#'
#' Method "piecelin" (default) should be used mostly for converting from
#' "continuous" to "discrete" type. It uses the fact that 'pdqr' densities are
#' piecewise-linear (linear in intervals between values of "x" column of
#' ["x_tbl" metadata][meta_x_tbl()]) on their [support][meta_support()]:
#' - Retyping from "continuous" to `type` "discrete" is done by computing "x"
#' values as centers of interval masses with probabilities equal to interval
#' total probabilities.
#' - Retyping from "discrete" to `type` "continuous" is made approximately by
#' trying to compute "x" grid, for which "x" values of input distribution are
#' going to be centers of mass. Algorithm is approximate and might result into a
#' big errors in case of small number of "x" values or if they are not
#' "suitable" for this kind of transformation.
#'
#' Method "dirac" is used mostly for converting from "discrete" to "continuous"
#' type (for example, in `form_mix()` in case different types of input
#' pdqr-functions). It works in the following way:
#' - Retyping from "continuous" to `type` "discrete" works only if "x_tbl"
#' metadata represents a mixture of dirac-like distributions. In that case it is
#' transformed to have "x" values from centers of those dirac-like distributions
#' with corresponding probabilities.
#' - Retyping from "discrete" to `type` "continuous" works by transforming each
#' "x" value from "x_tbl" metadata into dirac-like distribution with total
#' probability taken from corresponding value of "prob" column. Output
#' essentially represents a mixture of dirac-like distributions.
#'
#' Method "value" uses renormalized columns of `f`'s "x_tbl" metadata as values
#' for output's "x_tbl" metadata. In other words, it preserves ratios between
#' values of d-function at certain "x" points. Its main advantages are that this
#' method can work well with any pdqr type and that two consecutive conversions
#' return the same function. Conversion algorithm is as follows:
#' - Retyping from "continuous" to `type` "discrete" is done by creating
#' pdqr-function of corresponding class with the following "x_tbl" metadata: "x"
#' column is the same as in `f`; "prob" column is equal to `f`'s "y" column
#' after renormalization (so that their sum is 1).
#' - Retyping from "discrete" to `type` "continuous" is done in the same
#' fashion: "x" column is the same; "y" column is equal to `f`'s "prob" column
#' after renormalization (so that total integral of piecewise-linear density is
#' equal to 1).
#'
#' @return A pdqr-function with type equal to input `type`.
#'
#' @seealso [form_regrid()] for changing grid (rows of "x_tbl" metadata) of
#'   pdqr-function.
#'
#' [form_resupport()] for changing support of pdqr-function.
