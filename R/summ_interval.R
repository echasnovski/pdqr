#' Summarize distribution with interval
#'
#' These functions summarize distribution with one interval based on method of
#' choice.
#'
#' @inheritParams summ_mean
#' @param level A number between 0 and 1 representing a coverage degree of
#'   interval. Interpretation depends on `method` but the bigger is number, the
#'   wider is interval.
#' @param method Method of interval computation. Should be on of "minwidth",
#'   "percentile", "sigma".
#' @param n_grid Number of grid elements to be used for "minwidth" method (see
#'   Details).
#'
#' @details Method "minwidth" searches for an interval with total probability of
#' `level` that has minimum width. This is done with grid search: `n_grid`
#' possible intervals with `level` total probability are computed and the one
#' with minimum width is returned (if there are several, the one with the
#' smallest left end). Left ends of computed set of intervals are created as a
#' grid from `0` to `1-level` quantiles with `n_grid` number of elements. Right
#' ends are computed so that intervals have `level` total probability.
#'
#' Method "percentile" returns an interval with edges being `0.5*(1-level)` and
#' `1 - 0.5*(1-level)` quantiles. Output has total probability equal to `level`.
#'
#' Method "sigma" computes an interval symmetrically centered at
#' [mean][summ_mean()] of distribution. Left and right edges are distant from
#' center by the amount of [standard deviation][summ_sd()] multiplied by
#' `level`'s critical value. Critical value is computed using [normal
#' distribution][stats::qnorm()] as `qnorm(1 - 0.5*(1-level))`, which
#' corresponds to a way of computing sample confidence interval with known
#' standard deviation. The final output interval is possibly cut so that not to
#' be out of `f`'s [support][meta_support()].
#'
#' **Note** that supported methods correspond to different ways of computing
#' [distribution's center][summ_center()]. This idea is supported by the fact
#' that when `level` is 0, "minwidth" method returns zero width interval at
#' distribution's [global mode][summ_mode()], "percentile" method -
#' [median][summ_median()], "sigma" - [mean][summ_mean()].
#'
#' @return A [region][region] with one row. That is a data frame with one row
#'   and the following columns:
#' - **left** <dbl> : Left end of interval.
#' - **right** <dbl> : Right end of interval.
#'
#' To return a simple numeric vector, call [unlist()][base::unlist()] on
#' `summ_interval()`'s output (see Examples).
#'
#' @seealso [summ_hdr()] for computing of Highest Density Region, which can
#'   summarize distribution with multiple intervals.
