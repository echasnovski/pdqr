#' Change grid of pdqr-function
#'
#' Modify grid of pdqr-function (rows of ["x_tbl" metadata][meta_x_tbl()]) to
#' increase (upgrid) or decrease (downgrid) granularity using method of choice.
#' Upgridding might be useful in order to obtain more information during certain
#' type of transformations. Downgridding might be useful for decreasing amount
#' of used memory for storing pdqr-function without losing much information.
#'
#' @param f A pdqr-function.
#' @param n_grid A desired number of grid elements in output.
#' @param method Regrid method. Should be one of "x" or "q".
#'
#' @details The goal here is to create pdqr-function which is reasonably similar
#'   to `f` and has `n_grid` rows in "x_tbl" metadata.
#'
#' General algorithm of regridding is as follows:
#' - **Compute reference grid**. For method "x" it is a sequence of equidistant
#' points between edges of `f`'s [support][meta_support()]. For method "q" -
#' sequence of quantiles for equidistant probabilities from 0 to 1. Lengths of
#' reference grids for both methods are `n_grid`.
#' - **Adjust `f`'s grid to reference one**. This is done depending on `f`'s
#' [type][meta_type()] and which kind or regridding is done (upgridding is the
#' case when `n_grid` is strictly more than number of rows in "x_tbl" metadata,
#' downgridding - when it is strictly less):
#'     - Type "fin":
#'         - UPgridding "fin" functions is not possible as it is assumed that
#'         input "fin" functions can't have any "x" values other then present
#'         ones. In this case input is returned, the only case when output
#'         doesn't have desired `n_grid` rows in "x_tbl" metadata.
#'         - DOWNgridding "fin" functions is done by computing nearest match of
#'         reference grid to `f`'s one and collapsing (by summing probabilities)
#'         all "x" values from input to the nearest matched ones. Here
#'         "computing nearest match" means that every element of reference grid
#'         is one-one matched with subset of unique values from `f`'s "x"
#'         elements. Matching is done in greedy iterative fashion in order to
#'         minimize total distance between reference grid and matched subset.
#'         **Note** that this can result in not optimal (with not minimum total
#'         distance) match and can take a while to compute in some cases.
#'     - Type "infin":
#'         - UPgridding "infin" functions is done by adding rows to "x_tbl"
#'         metadata with "x" values equal to those elements of reference grid
#'         which are the furthest away from input "x" grid as a set. Distance
#'         from point to set is meant as minimum of distances between point and
#'         all points of set. Values of "y" and "cumprob" columns are taken as
#'         values of corresponding to `f` d- and p-functions.
#'         - DOWNgridding "infin" functions is done by computing nearest match
#'         of reference grid to `f`'s one (as for "fin" type) and removing all
#'         unmatched rows from "x_tbl" metadata.
#'
#' Special cases of `n_grid`:
#' - If `n_grid` is the same as number of rows in "x_tbl" metadata, then input
#' `f` is returned.
#' - If `n_grid` is 1, appropriate `new_*()` function is used with single
#' numeric input equal to distribution's median.
