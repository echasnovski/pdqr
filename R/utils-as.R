# Documentation of `as_*()` -----------------------------------------------
#' Convert to pdqr-function
#'
#' Convert some function to be a proper pdqr-function of specific
#' [class][meta_class()], i.e. a function describing distribution with finite
#' support and finite values of probability/density.
#'
#' @param f Appropriate function to be converted (see Details).
#' @param support Numeric vector with two increasing elements describing desired
#'   support of output. If `NULL` or any its value is `NA`, detection is done
#'   using specific algorithms (see Details).
#' @param ... Extra arguments to `f`.
#' @param n_grid Number of grid points at which `f` will be evaluated (see
#'   Details). Bigger values lead to better approximation precision, but worse
#'   memory usage and evaluation speed (direct and in `summ_*()` functions).
#' @param n_sample Number of points to sample from `f` inside `as_r()`.
#' @param args_new List of extra arguments for [new_d()] to control [density()]
#'   inside `as_r()`.
#'
#' @details General purpose of `as_*()` functions is to create a proper
#' pdqr-function of desired class from input which doesn't satisfy these
#' conditions. Here is described sequence of steps which are taken to achieve
#' that goal.
#'
#' If **`f` is already a pdqr-function**, `as_*()` functions properly update it
#' to have specific class. They take input's ["x_tbl" metadata][meta_x_tbl()]
#' and [type][meta_type()] to use with corresponding [new_*()][new-pdqr]
#' function. For example, `as_p(f)` in case of pdqr-function `f` is essentially
#' the same as `new_p(x = meta_x_tbl(f), type = meta_type(f))`.
#'
#' If **`f` is a function describing "honored" distribution**, it is detected
#' and output is created in predefined way taking into account extra arguments
#' in `...`. For more details see "Honored distributions" section.
#'
#' If **`f` is some other unknown function**, `as_*()` functions use heuristics
#' for approximating input distribution with a "proper" pdqr-function. Outputs
#' of `as_*()` can be only pdqr-functions of type "continuous" (because of
#' issues with support detection). It is assumed that `f` returns values
#' appropriate for desired output class of `as_*()` function and output type
#' "continuous". For example, input for `as_p()` should return values of some
#' continuous cumulative distribution function (monotonically non-increasing
#' values from 0 to 1). To manually create function of type "discrete", supply
#' data frame input describing it to appropriate `new_*()` function.
#'
#' General algorithm of how `as_*()` functions work for unknown function is as
#' follows:
#' - **Detect support**. See "Support detection" section for more details.
#' - **Create data frame input for `new_*()`**. The exact process differs:
#'     - In `as_p()` equidistant grid of `n_grid` points is created inside
#'     detected support. After that, input's values at the grid is taken as
#'     reference points of cumulative distribution function used to
#'     *approximate* density at that same grid. This method showed to work more
#'     reliably in case density goes to infinity. That grid and density values
#'     are used as "x" and "y" columns of data frame input for `new_p()`.
#'     - In `as_d()` "x" column of data frame is the same equidistant grid is
#'     taken as in `as_p()`. "y" column is taken as input's values at this grid
#'     after possibly imputing infinity values. This imputation is done by
#'     taking maximum from left and right linear extrapolations on mentioned
#'     grid.
#'     - In `as_q()`, at first inverse of input `f` function is computed on \[0;
#'     1\] interval. It is done by approximating it with piecewise-linear
#'     function on \[0; 1\] equidistant grid with `n_grid` points, imputing
#'     infinity values (which ensures finite support), and computing inverse of
#'     approximation. This inverse of `f` is used to create data frame input
#'     with `as_p()`.
#'     - In `as_r()` at first d-function with `new_d()` is created based on the
#'     same sample used for support detection and extra arguments supplied as
#'     list in `args_new` argument. In other words, density estimation is done
#'     based on sample, generated from input `f`. After that, its values are
#'     used to create data frame with `as_d()`.
#' - **Use appropriate `new_*()` function** with data frame from previous step
#' and `type = "continuous"`. This step implies that all tails outside detected
#' support are trimmed and data frame is normalized to represent proper
#' piecewise-linear density.
#'
#' @section Honored distributions:
#'
#' For efficient workflow, some commonly used distributions are recognized as
#' special ("honored"). Those receive different treatment in `as_*()` functions.
#'
#' Basically, there is a manually selected list of "honored" distributions with
#' all their information enough to detect them. Currently that list has all
#' common univariate distributions [from 'stats' package][stats::Distributions],
#' i.e. all except multinomial and "less common distributions of test
#' statistics".
#'
#' "Honored" distribution is **recognized only if `f` is one of `p*()`, `d*()`,
#' `q*()`, or `r*()` function describing honored distribution and is supplied as
#' variable with original name**. For example, `as_d(dunif)` will be treated as
#' "honored" distribution but `as_d(function(x) {dunif(x)})` will not.
#'
#' After it is recognized that input `f` represents "honored" distribution,
#' **its support is computed based on predefined rules**. Those take into
#' account special features of distribution (like infinite support or infinite
#' density values) and supplied extra arguments in `...`. Usually output support
#' "loses" only around `1e-6` probability on each infinite tail.
#'
#' After that, for "discrete" type output `new_d()` is used for appropriate data
#' frame input and for "continuous" - `as_d()` with appropriate `d*()` function
#' and support. D-function is then converted to desired class with `as_*()`.
#'
#' @section Support detection:
#'
#' In case input is a function without any extra information, `as_*()` functions
#' must know which finite support its output should have. User can supply
#' desired support directly with `support` argument, which can also be `NULL`
#' (mean automatic detection of both edges) or have `NA` to detect only those
#' edges.
#'
#' Support is detected in order to preserve as much information as practically
#' reasonable. Exact methods differ:
#' - In `as_p()` support is detected as values at which input function is equal
#' to `1e-6` (left edge detection) and `1 - 1e-6` (right edge), which means
#' "losing" `1e-6` probability on each tail. **Note** that those values are
#' searched inside \[-10^100; 10^100\] interval.
#' - In `as_d()`, at first an attempt at finding one point of non-zero density
#' is made by probing 10000 points spread across wide range of real line
#' (approximately from `-1e7` to `1e7`). If input's value at all of them is
#' zero, error is thrown. After finding such point, cumulative distribution
#' function is made by integrating input with [integrate()][stats::integrate()]
#' using found point as reference (without this there will be poor accuracy of
#' `integrate()`). Created CDF function is used to find `1e-6` and `1 - 1e-6`
#' quantiles as in `as_p()`, which serve as detected support.
#' - In `as_q()` quantiles for 0 and 1 are probed for being infinite. If they
#' are, `1e-6` and `1 - 1e-6` quantiles are used respectively instead of
#' infinite values to form detected support.
#' - In `as_r()` sample of size `n_sample` is generated and detected support is
#' its range stretched by mean difference of sorted points (to account for
#' possible tails at which points were not generated). **Note** that this means
#' that original input `f` "demonstrates its randomness" only once inside
#' `as_r()`, with output then used for approximation of "original randomness".

#' doesn't belong to zero probability tail because it is used to define positive
