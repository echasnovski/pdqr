\title{Create a pdqr-function for distribution of sample estimate}
\usage{
form_estimate(f, estimate, sample_size, ..., n_sample = 10000,
  args_new = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{f}{A pdqr-function.}

\item{estimate}{Estimate function. Should be able to accept numeric vector of
size \code{sample_size} and return single numeric or logical output.}

\item{sample_size}{Size of sample for which distribution of sample estimate
is needed.}

\item{...}{Other arguments for \code{estimate}.}

\item{n_sample}{Number of elements to generate from distribution of sample
estimate.}

\item{args_new}{List of extra arguments for \link[=new-pdqr]{new_*()} function to
control \code{\link[=density]{density()}}.}
}
\value{
A pdqr-function of the same \link[=meta_class]{class} and
\link[=meta_type]{type} (if not forced otherwise in \code{args_new}) as \code{f}.
}
\description{
Based on pdqr-function, estimate function, and sample size describe the
distribution of sample estimate. This might be useful for statistical
inference.
}
\details{
General idea is to create a sample from target distribution by
generating \code{n_sample} samples of size \code{sample_size} and compute for each of
them its estimate by calling input \code{estimate} function. If created sample is
logical, \strong{boolean} pdqr-function (type "fin" with elements being exactly 0
and 1) is created with probability of being true estimated as share of \code{TRUE}
values (after removing possible \code{NA}). If sample is numeric, it is used as
input to \code{new_*()} of appropriate class with \code{type} equal to type of \code{f} (if
not forced otherwise in \code{args_new}).

\strong{Notes}:
\itemize{
\item This function may be very time consuming for large values of \code{n_sample} and
\code{sample_size}, as total of \code{n_sample*sample_size} numbers are generated and
\code{estimate} function is called \code{n_sample} times.
\item Output distribution might have a bias compared to true distribution of
sample estimate. One useful technique for bias correction: compute mean value
of estimate using big \code{sample_size} (with \code{mean(as_r(f)(sample_size))}) and
then recenter distribution to actually have that as a mean.
