\title{Transform tails of distribution}
\usage{
form_tails(f, level, method = "trim", direction = "both")
}
\arguments{
\item{f}{A pdqr-function.}

\item{level}{Cutoff level. For direction "both" should be between 0 and 0.5;
for "left" and "right" - between 0 and 1.}

\item{method}{Modification method. One of "trim" or "winsor".}

\item{direction}{Information about which tail(s) to modify. One of "both",
"left", "right".}
}
\value{
A pdqr-function with transformed tail(s).
}
\description{
Modify tail(s) of distribution defined by certain cutoff level using method
of choice. This function is useful for doing robust analysis in presence of
possible outliers.
}
\details{
Edges for left and right tails are computed as \code{level} and \code{1 - level} quantiles respectively. The left tail is interval to the left of
left edge, and right tail - to the right of right edge.

Method "trim" removes tail(s) while normalizing "center part". Method
"winsor" "squashes" tails inside center of distribution in dirac-like
fashion, i.e. probability of tail(s) is moved inside and becomes concentrated
in \code{1e-8} neighborhood of nearest edge.

Direction "both" affect both tails. Directions "left" and "right" affect only
left and right tail respectively.
